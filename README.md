# Data Structures Project 

## Primary Data Structure

The primary data structure that this project uses is the **Octree**.

## Problem

The problem that this project tackles is that it reduces the time and space complexity of rendering objects in 3D using the Octree. 

An Octree is a special type of structure used to store spatial data. It reduces the time and space complexity of 3D surface rendering by accessing only sufficient amount of data at a particular level of detail.

## Application

The application of this project is that it takes a point cloud data of a 3D object and it converts its data into an octree data and produces a Wavefront Object (.obj) file that can be rendered by any 3D rendering platform.
